             * Statement ends with semi-colon.
             * For example, the line which initializes a variable by assigning it a value is a statement.
             * A C# program contains multiple statements grouped in blocks. A block is code segment enclosed in curly braces.
             * Statement can consists of
             *  - data types
             *  - variables
             *  - operators
             *  - constants

             * Statement help you build a logical flow in the program.
