/*
- Basic Theory

- AJAX - asynchronous javascript and xml

- HTTP Request

- is a set of 'web development technique'
using many web technologies on the 'client-side'
to create asynchronous web applications.

- with ajax, web applications can send and receive
data ffrom a server asynchronously (in the background)
without interfacing with the display and 
behaviour of the existing page.

- We don't use data in XML format anymore.
- we use JSON now.

we have 3 most common ways to create and request to server
- 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
- 2.) fetch aPI(new way of doing)
- 3.) axios (this is third party library)
